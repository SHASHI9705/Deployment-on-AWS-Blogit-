Step 1: Set Up Amazon DocumentDB
Amazon DocumentDB is a managed MongoDB-compatible database.

Go to Amazon DocumentDB â†’ "Create Cluster"

Choose:

Engine version: MongoDB 4.0/5.0-compatible

Instance type: db.t3.medium (or smaller for cost)

VPC: Use the same VPC as your EC2

Enable backup and monitoring

Create a security group that allows inbound access from your EC2 instances only

Note the cluster endpoint (use this in your app)
